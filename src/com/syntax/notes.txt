what is method
in java, method is block of code(group of java statements). define behaviour of class
why:
helps to remove duplicate codes from our application
methods in form of modules which makes dev of large applicatons easier
how to use:
1 create method inside a class(cannot exist w/o classes)
2 we create object of that class
3 we call method by writing the name of the object, a dot, name of the method
class calculator{
void add(int x, int y){
System.out.println(x+y)
}
public static void main (String[] args){
Calculator calculator=new Calculator();
calculator.add(w0,20);
}
}
rules:
void add(int x, int y){
System.out.println(x+y);
}
void=> void is a return type and it is a must
if you want to return an specific data write the name of that data type like for int for String we write String
if we dont want to return anything we write void
when we write a void we cant assign a method call to variable
add+> next we write a name of method which can be anything it
should follow the rules for giving a name to a variable
methods do somthing so () used to specify the parameters. any datatype in the paranthesis
they are optional and we can leave them empty
{
Sytem.out.print len (x+y);  // the body of the method
}
add(int x, int y) name and parameters is called the signature of method
void add(int x, int y) header of the method
to ignore bugs then double shift excludes and choose class or complete packages
minus minus minus to include again

type of Variables in Java:
there are three type variables in java.
1. Local variable:
 if a variable is inside a method or a part of its parameters or a loop
or switch statement it is called a local variable.
2. Instance variable:
 if a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
switch statement if else condition it is called an instance variable.
3. Static Variables:
 if an instance variable has a static keyword with it than it is called static variable.
  WHY LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF VARIABLES?
 1.IT HELPS US REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF "RAM"THAT OUR APPLICATIONS WILL BE USING WHEN IT WILL BE RUNNING.
 2. WITH THE HELP OF THESE VARIABLES WE CAN PASS THE INFORMATION BETWEEN METHODS OF CLASS.
